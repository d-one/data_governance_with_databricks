# How to use the content

In order to be able to recreate the example you need to have modification rights for a catalog, please contact your admin if you don't. Alternatively, see the following documentation if you need to create a new one: https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/create-catalogs.html

In the materials below the catalog is assumed to be named "store_data_catalog". Make sure you change it to the name of the catalog you are planning to work with.

Steps:
 * Downlod the DBC archive file from this repo
 * Upload it to your workspace in Databricks via import file
 * If needed - change the name of the catalog in the notebook and the sql queries
 * Run the Notebook
 * Review the result in the catalog. It should looke similar to
