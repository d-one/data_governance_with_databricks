# How to use the content

In order to be able to recreate the example you need to have modification rights for a catalog, please contact your admin if you don't. Alternatively, see the following documentation if you need to create a new one: https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/create-catalogs.html

In the materials below the catalog is assumed to be named "store_data_catalog". Make sure you change it to the name of the catalog you are planning to work with.

#### Steps
* Downlod the DBC archive file from this repo
* Upload it to your workspace in Databricks via import file
* If needed - change the name of the catalog in the notebook (mind, there are multiple locations) and the sql queries
* Run the Notebook
* Review the result in the catalog. It should looke similar to the following image:
![Expected Catalog](./images/expected_catalog.png)
* Run the data quality queries
* Configure visualisations and create a data quality dashboard (see separate instructions below)

#### Configuring visualisations
1. Detailed health check report:
Navigate to the query "blog_post_generating_dq_report". After execution there will appear a tab called "Results" at the bottom. Double click on the name "Results" and change it to something meaningful, such as "Full data quality check report". Click on the arrow next to the tab name and choose edit as indicated by the following image:

![Configure Report p1](./images/configure_table_p1.png)
A window should open with options to configure the visualisation. In this case we are interested in a detailed, tabular report, therefore, make sure the upper left corner shows "Table" under "Visualization type":

![Configure Report p2](./images/configure_table_p2.png)
To draw attention to failed checks we would like to colour several attributes in orange. Click on each of the following attributes: "Check", "Data Element" and "Check Status" and add a condition as shown in the following image: 
![Configure Report p3](./images/configure_table_p3.png)
After clicking on "Save" at the bottom right corner navigate back to query, and you should the result at the bottom looking similar to the following image (mind, the exact values may be different):

![Configure Report p4](./images/configure_table_p4.png)

2. Summary doughnut charts for data quality categories: Navigate to the query "blog_post_dq_category_summary". Similarly to the steps in (1) rename the "Results" to something meaningful, such as "dq_summary_category". In the "Edit" pop-up choose "Pie" under "Visualization type" and set the X column to "Check Status" and the Y to Count (Sum). Group by the "check_type". Your configuration should be similar to this:

![Configure Summary p1](./images/configure_doughnut_p1.png)
To set the colours navigate to the "Colors" tab and click on the colour to change it to the ones presented in the image below:

![Configure Summary p2](./images/configure_doughnut_p2.png)
Your doughnut charts should look like in the previous image.

3. General information regarding data checks execution:
Navigate to the query "blog_post_last_dq_execution". Similarly to the previous steps rename the "Results" to something meaningful, such as "last_dq_execution". In the "Edit" pop-up choose "Details View"; it should now look like this:

![Configure Details View](./images/configure_detail_view.png)

#### Create a dashboard

You can create a dashboard from within a query. Navigate to the one of the queries, for example to "blog_post_generating_dq_report". Click on the menu from next to one of results tabs (in which we configured the visualisations) and choose "Add to dashboard" as depicted here:

![Create Dashboard p1](./images/create_dashboard_p1.png)

Click on "Create new dashboard" and choose a name, for example, "Store Transactions: Data Quality" and click on "Add", such as:

![Create Dashboard p2](./images/create_dashboard_p2.png)

Choose the newly created dashboard and click on "Add".
Add the other two visualizations to the already existing dashboard.

From the menu on the left hand-side go to the "Dashboard" section. You should see the new dashboard there, similar to the following:

![Create Dashboard p3](./images/create_dashboard_p3.png)

Opening the dashboard you should see the 3 visualisations looking somewhat messy. Choose "Edit" in the menu in the top-right corner (next to the "Refresh" button). Organise the dashboard by licking and drag-and-dropping the different visualisations to the wished locations. The bottom right corner has an arrow that allows resizing (see the blue rectangle in the doughnut charts):

![Create Dashboard p4](./images/create_dashboard_p4.png)

To modify the title, click on the settings of a visualisation and choose "Change widget settings":

![Create Dashboard p5](./images/create_dashboard_p5.png)

You can customise the title under "Customize the title for this widget":

![Create Dashboard p6](./images/create_dashboard_p6.png)

Once you are done reviewing other options don't forget to click "Save" at the bottom-right - you might need to scroll for this.

After applying all the changes click on "Done editing" at the upper right corner and voila - you dashboard is ready :)
